## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to scrape information from a web page and process it with artificial intelligence. In this specific case, we're scraping movie data from Rotten Tomatoes and using GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate additional text based on the scraped content.

## Technologies Used

- Puppeteer: A Node.js library for controlling headless browsers.
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo: A powerful text generation model by OpenAI.
- JavaScript: The primary programming language used.
- Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- Other dependencies (list them if you have additional libraries)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in the code: Replace `your-api-key` with your actual API key.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Run the script: `node your-script.js`
2. The script will scrape movie data and generate additional text.
3. Customize the prompt template in your code for different text generation tasks.

# Building a Dynamic Web Scraper and Text Analyst

In the realm of web development and data analysis, our project titled "Dynamic-Web-Scrapper-and-Analyst" is a testament to the power of automation and artificial intelligence. Whether you're a frontend web developer, a data enthusiast, or someone keen on exploring the world of web scraping and AI, this project is a treasure trove of knowledge and skills.

## The Foundation

Our project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools that you might already be familiar with:

- **Puppeteer:** We leverage Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, to navigate and scrape data from web pages. In our case, we've demonstrated this by fetching movie data from a dynamically changing website.

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo:** To add an intelligent twist to our project, we've integrated OpenAI's powerful language model. It's capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on prompts, making it an excellent choice for text analysis.

- **Node.js:** The backend of our project is built using Node.js, a popular server-side JavaScript runtime. It's the glue that holds everything together, from web scraping to AI-powered text analysis.

## The Process

Our project follows a well-structured workflow:

### Web Scraping with Puppeteer

We start by setting up Puppeteer to scrape data from a dynamic website. In our demonstration, we've used a movie website as an example. However, you can adapt this process to extract information from various websites. Puppeteer provides the ability to navigate to web pages, interact with elements, and extract data. It's an invaluable tool for data acquisition.

### Text Analysis with OpenAI

After scraping the data, we move on to text analysis. This is where the magic of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo comes into play. We break down the extracted text into manageable chunks and send them to GPT-3.5 Turbo for analysis. Using predefined prompts, we instruct the AI model to extract specific information from the text. In our case, we asked it to identify movie titles, years, and ratings.

### The Integration

The integration of Puppeteer and OpenAI is seamless. Puppeteer handles the data acquisition, while OpenAI adds a layer of intelligence to interpret and analyze the text. This combination allows us to automate the extraction of valuable insights from web content.

## The Versatility

What's exciting about our project is its versatility. While we've showcased it with a movie website, you can apply the same principles to a wide range of use cases. Whether you're interested in market research, news aggregation, or any data-driven task, this project serves as a blueprint for building your web scraper and text analyst.

## Your Journey

If you're a frontend web developer looking to expand your skill set or a data enthusiast seeking to harness the power of automation and AI, this project is a valuable resource. It equips you with the knowledge and tools to create dynamic web scrapers and intelligent text analyzers. You can adapt and extend this project to suit your specific interests and needs.

So, embark on this journey of discovery, automation, and intelligence. Build your own dynamic web scraper and text analyst, and unlock a world of possibilities in web development and data analysis.
